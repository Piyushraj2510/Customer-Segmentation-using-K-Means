# ðŸ“Š Data-Driven Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

This project leverages **K-Means Clustering** to segment customers based on their behavioral and demographic data, helping businesses to better understand their customer base and personalize marketing strategies.  

## ðŸš€ Features  

- **Customer Insights**: Cluster customers into meaningful segments based on purchase patterns, demographics, and engagement metrics.  
- **K-Means Algorithm**: Implements one of the most popular unsupervised machine learning techniques for clustering.  
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize clusters in 2D or 3D to gain intuitive insights into customer groups.  
- **Scalable Design**: Works with various datasets, allowing easy adaptation for different industries.  


## ðŸ§  Working  

1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Handles missing values and outliers.  
   - Scales features using MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler for optimal clustering.  

2. **K-Means Clustering**:  
   - Determines the optimal number of clusters using the **Elbow Method** or **Silhouette Score**.  
   - Groups customers based on feature similarity.  

3. **Cluster Analysis**:  
   - Assigns each customer to a cluster.  
   - Generates summary statistics and visualizations for each group.  

4. **Visualization**:  
   - Plots clusters in 2D/3D space using PCA or t-SNE for dimensionality reduction.  


## ðŸ“ˆ Results  

The project provides:  
- **Cluster Assignments**: Each customer is assigned to a cluster.  
- **Cluster Profiles**: Key characteristics of each cluster are summarized for business insights.  
- **Visualizations**: Graphs to help interpret customer segments intuitively.  

## ðŸ”§ Future Improvements  

- Add advanced clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering).  
- Incorporate feature selection techniques for high-dimensional data.  
- Automate the determination of the optimal number of clusters.
